1. I have had a little problems with the proper time to merge branches into the master.
2. After the pairing session I got some clearification of when to merge. I found out that is you are saving the file to your computer you merge on git. But if you push it up to github you should merge at github
3. My main question I asked my pair was about the proper use of certain command as well as some proper ways to do google hang outs. As for my guide they were more focused around how well I interacted witb my pair
4. I still have a few hangs on how you can reference a file in git and be able to access through the command line
5. Over all it was very informative it showed me so very useful stategies to make future pairing sessions go smoother
