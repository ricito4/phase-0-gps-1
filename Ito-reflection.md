# Reflection GPS 1.1
----
What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS Session?
I was a bit slow with the Github workflow process. I had trouble understanding what master and origin were refering to which made the fetch and merge commands difficult. We also learned that we should push the branches we edited to github instead of the master.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
Definitely the terms origin, master and that we could add other origins. 

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
Most questions were usually when we would use a certain command or what the syntax was for executing a command.

What still confused you about Git?
While my understanding of Git has improved, I still mix up how to reference certain files. 

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
I enjoyed it! It was nice to see how when we hit roadblocks how we would get out of those situations. Jacob was very helpful as a navigator and very receptive when he was the driver and I hope I was the same.
